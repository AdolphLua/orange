To debug Orange with MS Visual C++ 6.0, you can either change
settings for Release version to include debug info (set optimization
to None, and check debug info in 'compile' and 'link' tab) or
compile Debug version of Orange. The former is suitable for
minor debugging, while the latter is recommended if you plan
to play with Orange for a little longer.

The latter also requires a Debug version of Python and its modules
(they can be recognized by a _d appended at the end of the filename,
ie. python_d.exe, python23_d.dll, _sre_d.pyd ...). Luckily, source
distribution of Python includes the necessary .dsw file for Visual
Studio. All you usually need to do is to correct a few paths.

So, if you want to build a debug version of Python, do the following:
- Have Python installed as usual, say you've put it in c:\Python23.
- Download Python sources and unzip them.
- You'll notice that Python sources are in subdirectory Python-2.3.
  Copy them to c:\Python23 (so that, for istance, Python-2.3/doc
  comes over c:\Python23\doc.
- Open c:\Python23\PCbuild\pcbuild.dsw with Visual Studio.
- Go to project settings and change Link/General/Output filename as
  follows:
  - .pyd need to go to ../Dlls
  - .exe go to .. (there are three: python, pythonw and w9xpopen)
  - .dll goes to c:\winnt\system32 (or wherever your windows system
    directory is)
- For project 'pythoncore' set General/Output files to ../libs
- Build. Some projects won't build due to missing stuff. Don't mind,
  go to the next file.
  
That's it. Python_d.exe will appear beside python.exe. If you run it,
'import orange' will import orange_d.pyd instead of orange.pyd etc.
