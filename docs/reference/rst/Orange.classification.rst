Classification (``classification``)
###################################

To facilitate correct evaluation, all classifiers in Orange consist of two
parts, a Learner and a Classifier. A learner is constructed with all
parameters that will be used for learning. When a data table is passed to its
__call__ method, a model is fitted to the data and return in a form of a
Classifier, which is then used for predicting the dependent variable(s) of
new instances.

.. class:: Learner()

    Base class for all orange learners.

    .. method:: __call__(instances)

        Fit a model and return it as an instance of :class:`Classifier`.

        This method is abstract and needs to be implemented on each learner.

.. class:: Classifier()

    Base class for all orange classifiers.

    .. attribute:: GetValue

        Return value of the target class when performing prediction.

    .. attribute:: GetProbabilities

        Return probability of each target class when performing prediction.

    .. attribute:: GetBoth

        Return a tuple of target class value and probabilities for each class.


    .. method:: __call__(instances, return_type)

        Classify a new instance using this model.

        This method is abstract and needs to be implemented on each classifier.

        :param instance: data instance to be classified.
        :type instance: :class:`~Orange.data.Instance`

        :param return_type: what needs to be predicted
        :type return_type: :obj:`GetBoth`,
                           :obj:`GetValue`,
                           :obj:`GetProbabilities`

        :rtype: :class:`~Orange.data.Value`,
              :class:`~Orange.statistics.distribution.Distribution` or a
              tuple with both


When developing new prediction models, one should extend :obj:`Learner` and
:obj:`Classifier`\. Code that infers the model from the data should be placed
in Learners's :obj:`~Learner.__call__` method. This method should
return a :obj:`Classifier`. Classifiers' :obj:`~Classifier.__call__` method
should  return the predicition; :class:`~Orange.data.Value`,
:class:`~Orange.statistics.distribution.Distribution` or a tuple with both
based on the value of the parameter :obj:`return_type`.

Orange implements various classifiers that are described in detail on
separate pages.
