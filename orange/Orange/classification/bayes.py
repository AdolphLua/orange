Naive Bayes Classifier
======================

The most primitive bayesian classifier is :obj:`NaiveLearner` 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier).
The class estimates conditional probabilities from training data and uses them
for classification of new examples. 

Example (`bayes-run.py`_, uses `iris.tab`_)

Examples
========
Example (`bayes-run.py`_, uses `iris.tab`_)

.. literalinclude:: code/bayes-run.py
    :lines: 7-
    
Let us load the data, induce a classifier and see how it performs on the first
five examples.

>>> from Orange import *
>>> table = data.Table("lenses")
>>> bayes = classification.bayes.NaiveLearner(table)
>>>
>>> for ex in table[:5]:
...    print ex.getclass(), bayes(ex)
no no
no no
soft soft
no no
hard hard

The classifier is correct in all five cases. Interested in probabilities,
maybe?

>>> for ex in table[:5]:
...     print ex.getclass(), bayes(ex, \
Orange.classification.Classifier.GetProbabilities)
no <0.423, 0.000, 0.577>
no <0.000, 0.000, 1.000>
soft <0.000, 0.668, 0.332>
no <0.000, 0.000, 1.000>
hard <0.715, 0.000, 0.285>

While very confident about the second and the fourth example, the classifier
guessed the correct class of the first one only by a small margin of 42 vs.
58 percents.

Now, let us peek into the classifier.

>>> print bayes.estimator
None
>>> print bayes.distribution
<0.167, 0.208, 0.625>
>>> print bayes.conditionalEstimators
None
>>> print bayes.conditionalDistributions[0]
<'young': <0.250, 0.250, 0.500>, 'p_psby': <0.125, 0.250, 0.625>, (...)
>>> bayes.conditionalDistributions[0]["young"]
<0.250, 0.250, 0.500>

The classifier has no estimator since probabilities are stored in distribution.
The probability of the first class is 0.167, of the second 0.208 and the
probability of the third class is 0.625. Nor does it have 
conditionalEstimators, probabilities are stored in conditionalDistributions.
We printed the contingency matrix for the first attribute and, in the last
line, conditional probabilities of the three classes when the value of the
first attribute is "young".

Let us now use m-estimate instead of relative frequencies.

>>> bayesl = classification.bayes.NaiveLearner(m=2.0)
>>> bayes = bayesl(table)

The classifier is still correct for all examples.

>>> for ex in table[:5]:
...     print ex.getclass(), bayes(ex, \
Orange.classification.Classifier.GetBoth)
no <0.375, 0.063, 0.562>;
no <0.016, 0.003, 0.981>
soft <0.021, 0.607, 0.372>
no <0.001, 0.039, 0.960>
hard <0.632, 0.030, 0.338>

Observing probabilities shows a shift towards the third, more frequent class -
as compared to probabilities above, where relative frequencies were used.

>>> print bayes.conditionalDistributions[0]
<'young': <0.233, 0.242, 0.525>, 'p_psby': <0.133, 0.242, 0.625>, (...)

Note that the change in error estimation did not have any effect on apriori
probabilities:

>>> print bayes.distribution
<0.167, 0.208, 0.625>

The reason for this is that this same distribution was used as apriori
distribution for m-estimation.

Finally, let us show an example with continuous attributes. We will take iris
dataset that contains four continuous and no discrete attributes.

>>> table = data.Table("iris")
>>> bayes = orange.BayesLearner(table)
>>> for exi in range(0, len(table), 20):
...     print data[exi].getclass(), bayes(table[exi], \
orange.Classifier.GetBoth)

The classifier works well. To see a glimpse of how it works, let us observe
conditional distributions for the first attribute. It is stored in
conditionalDistributions, as before, except that it now behaves as a
dictionary, not as a list like before (see information on distributions.

>>> print bayes.conditionalDistributions[0]
<4.300: <0.837, 0.137, 0.026>;, 4.333: <0.834, 0.140, 0.026>, 4.367: <0.830, \
(...)

For a nicer picture, we can print out the probabilities, copy and paste it to
some graph drawing program ... and get something like the figure below.

>>> for x, probs in bayes.conditionalDistributions[0].items():
...     print "%5.3f\t%5.3f\t%5.3f\t%5.3f" % (x, probs[0], probs[1], probs[2])
4.300   0.837   0.137   0.026
4.333   0.834   0.140   0.026
4.367   0.830   0.144   0.026
4.400   0.826   0.147   0.027
4.433   0.823   0.150   0.027
(...)

If petal lengths are shorter, the most probable class is "setosa". Irises with
middle petal lengths belong to "versicolor", while longer petal lengths
indicate for "virginica". Critical values where the decision would change are
at about 5.4 and 6.3.

It is important to stress that the curves are relatively smooth although no
fitting (either manual or automatic) of parameters took place.

Implementation Details
======================

Orange.core.BayesLearner
========================
The first three fields are empty (None) by default.

If estimatorConstructor is left undefined, p(C) will be estimated by relative
frequencies of examples (see ProbabilityEstimatorConstructor_relative).
When conditionalEstimatorConstructor is left undefined, it will use the same
constructor as for estimating unconditional probabilities (estimatorConstructor
is used as an estimator in (ConditionalProbabilityEstimatorConstructor_ByRows).
That is, by default, both will use relative frequencies. But when
estimatorConstructor is set to, for instance, estimate probabilities by
m-estimate with m=2.0, m-estimates with m=2.0 will be used for estimation of
conditional probabilities, too.
P(c|vi) for continuous attributes are, by default estimated with loess (a
variant of locally weighted linear regression), using
ConditionalProbabilityEstimatorConstructor_loess.
The learner first constructs an estimator for p(C). It tries to get a
precomputed distribution of probabilities; if the estimator is capable of
returning it, the distribution is stored in the classifier's field distribution
and the just constructed estimator is disposed. Otherwise, the estimator is
stored in the classifier's field estimator, while the distribution is left
empty.

The same is then done for conditional probabilities. Different constructors are
used for discrete and continuous attributes. If the constructed estimator can
return all conditional probabilities in form of Contingency, the contingency is
stored and the estimator disposed. If not, the estimator is stored. If there
are no contingencies when the learning is finished, the resulting classifier's
conditionalDistributions is None. Alternatively, if all probabilities are
stored as contingencies, the conditionalEstimators fields is None.

Field normalizePredictions is copied to the resulting classifier.

Orange.core.BayesClassifier
===========================
Class NaiveClassifier represents a naive Bayesian classifier. Probability of
class C, knowing that values of features :math:`F_1, F_2, ..., F_n` are
:math:`v_1, v_2, ..., v_n`, is computed as :math:`p(C|v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) = \
p(C) \\cdot \\frac{p(C|v_1)}{p(C)} \\cdot \\frac{p(C|v_2)}{p(C)} \\cdot ... \
\\cdot \\frac{p(C|v_n)}{p(C)}`.

Note that when relative frequencies are used to estimate probabilities, the
more usual formula (with factors of form :math:`\\frac{p(v_i|C)}{p(v_i)}`) and
the above formula are exactly equivalent (without any additional assumptions of
independency, as one could think at a first glance). The difference becomes
important when using other ways to estimate probabilities, like, for instance,
m-estimate. In this case, the above formula is much more appropriate. 

When computing the formula, probabilities p(C) are read from distribution which
is of type Distribution and stores a (normalized) probability of each class.
When distribution is None, BayesClassifier calls estimator to assess the
probability. The former method is faster and is actually used by all existing
methods of probability estimation. The latter is more flexible.

Conditional probabilities are computed similarly. Field conditionalDistribution
is of type DomainContingency which is basically a list of instances of
Contingency, one for each attribute; the outer variable of the contingency is
the attribute and the inner is the class. Contingency can be seen as a list of
normalized probability distributions. For attributes for which there is no
contingency in conditionalDistribution a corresponding estimator in
conditionalEstimators is used. The estimator is given the attribute value and
returns distributions of classes.

If neither, nor pre-computed contingency nor conditional estimator exist, the
attribute is ignored without issuing any warning. The attribute is also ignored
if its value is undefined; this cannot be overriden by estimators.

Any field (distribution, estimator, conditionalDistributions,
conditionalEstimators) can be None. For instance, BayesLearner normally
constructs a classifier which has either distribution or estimator defined.
While it is not an error, to have both, only distribution will be used in that
case. As for the other two fields, they can be both defined and used
complementarily; the elements which are missing in one are defined in the
other. However, if there is no need for estimators, BayesLearner will not
construct an empty list; it will not construct a list at all, but leave the
field conditionalEstimators empty.

If you only need probabilities of individual class call BayesClassifier's
method p(class, example) to compute the probability of this class only. Note
that this probability will not be normalized and will thus, in general, not
equal the probability returned by the call operator.
