Lookup classifiers
******************

Lookup classifiers predict classes by looking into stored lists of
cases. There are two kinds of such classifiers in Orange. The simpler
and fastest :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable` use up to three discrete
features and have a stored mapping from values of those features to
class value. The more complex classifiers store a
:obj:`Orange.data.Table` and predict the class by matching the instance
to instances in the table.

.. index::
   single: feature construction; lookup classifiers

A natural habitat for these classifiers is feature construction:
they usually reside in :obj:`getValueFrom` fields of constructed
features to facilitate their automatic computation. For instance,
the following script shows how to translate the `monks-1.tab`_ dataset
features into a more useful subset that will only include the features
a, b, e, and features that will tell whether a and b are equal and
whether e is 1 (don't bother about the details, they follow later; 
`lookup-lookup.py`_, uses: `monks-1.tab`_):

.. literalinclude:: code/lookup-lookup.py
    :lines: 7-21
    
We can check the correctness of the script by printing out several
random examples from data2.

    >>> for i in range(5):
    ...     print data2.randomexample()
    ['1', '1', 'yes', '4', 'no', '1']
    ['3', '3', 'yes', '2', 'no', '1']
    ['2', '1', 'no', '4', 'no', '0']
    ['2', '1', 'no', '1', 'yes', '1']
    ['1', '1', 'yes', '3', 'no', '1']

The first :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable` takes values of features a
and b and computes the value of ab according to the rule given in the
given table. The first three values correspond to a=1 and b=1, 2, 3;
for the first combination, value of ab should be "yes", for the other
two a and b are different. The next triplet correspond to a=2;
here, the middle value is "yes"...

The second lookup is simpler: since it involves only a single feature,
the list is a simple one-to-one mapping from the four-valued e to the
two-valued e1. The last value in the list is returned when e is unknown
and tells that e1 should be unknown then as well.

Note that you don't need :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable` for this.
The new feature e1 could be computed with a callback to Python,
for instance::

    e2.getValueFrom = lambda ex, rw: orange.Value(e2, ex["e"]=="1")


Classifiers by lookup table
===========================

.. index::
   single: classification; lookup table

Although the above example used :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable` as if it
was a concrete class, ClassifierByLookupTable is actually
abstract. Calling its constructor is a typical Orange trick: what you
get, is never ClassifierByLookupTable, but either
:obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable1`, :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable2` or
:obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable3`. As their names tell, the first
classifies using a single feature (so that's what we had for e1),
the second uses a pair of features (and has been constructed for ab
above), and the third uses three features. Class predictions for each
combination of feature values are stored in a (one dimensional) table.
To classify an instance, the classifier computes an index of the element
of the table that corresponds to the combination of feature values.

These classifiers are built to be fast, not safe. If you, for instance,
change the number of values for one of the features, Orange will
most probably crash. To protect you somewhat, many of these classes'
features are read-only and can only be set when the object is
constructed.


.. py:class:: Orange.classification.lookup.ClassifierByLookupTable(classVar, variable1[, variable2[, variable3]] [, lookupTable[, distributions]])
    
    A general constructor that, based on the number of attribute
    descriptors, constructs one of the three classes discussed.
    If lookupTable and distributions are omitted, constructor also
    initializes lookupTable and distributions to two lists of the
    right sizes, but their elements are don't knows and empty
    distributions. If they are given, they must be of correct size.
    
    .. attribute:: variable1[, variable2[, variable3]](read only)
        
        The feature(s) that the classifier uses for classification.
        ClassifierByLookupTable1 only has variable1,
        ClassifierByLookupTable2 also has variable2 and
        ClassifierByLookupTable3 has all three.

    .. attribute:: variables (read only)
        
        The above variables, returned as a tuple.

    .. attribute:: noOfValues1, noOfValues2[, noOfValues3] (read only)
        
        The number of values for variable1, variable2 and variable3.
        This is stored here to make the classifier faster. Those features
        are defined only for ClassifierByLookupTable2 (the first two) and
        ClassifierByLookupTable3 (all three).

    .. attribute:: lookupTable (read only)
        
        A list of values (ValueList), one for each possible combination of
        features. For ClassifierByLookupTable1, there is an additional
        element that is returned when the feature's value is unknown.
        Values are ordered by values of features, with variable1 being the
        most important. In case of two three valued features, the list
        order is therefore 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 3-1, 3-2, 3-3,
        where the first digit corresponds to variable1 and the second to
        variable2.
        
        The list is read-only in the sense that you cannot assign a new
        list to this field. You can, however, change its elements. Don't
        change its size, though. 

    .. attribute:: distributions (read only)
        
        Similar to :obj:`lookupTable`, but is of type DistributionList
        and stores a distribution for each combination of values. 

    .. attribute:: dataDescription
        
        An object of type EFMDataDescription, defined only for
        ClassifierByLookupTable2 and ClassifierByLookupTable3. They use
        it to make predictions when one or more feature values are unknown.
        ClassifierByLookupTable1 doesn't need it since this case is covered
        by an additional element in lookupTable and distributions,
        as told above.
        
    .. method:: getindex(example)
    
        Returns an index into lookupTable or distributions. The formula
        depends upon the type of the classifier. If value\ *i* is
        int(example[variable\ *i*]), then the corresponding formulae are

        ClassifierByLookupTable1:
            index = value1, or len(lookupTable)-1 if value is unknown
        ClassifierByLookupTable2:
            index = value1*noOfValues1 + value2, or -1 if any value is unknown 
        ClassifierByLookupTable3:
            index = (value1*noOfValues1 + value2) * noOfValues2 + value3, or -1 if any value is unknown

        Let's see some indices for randomly chosen examples from the original table.

.. py:class:: Orange.classification.lookup.ClassifierByLookupTable1(classVar, variable1 [, lookupTable, distributions])
    
    Uses a single feature for lookup. See
    :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable` for more details.

.. py:class:: Orange.classification.lookup.ClassifierByLookupTable2(classVar, variable1, variable2, [, lookupTable[, distributions]])
    
    Uses two features for lookup. See
    :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable` for more details.
        
.. py:class:: Orange.classification.lookup.ClassifierByLookupTable3(classVar, variable1, variable2, variable3, [, lookupTable[, distributions]])
    
    Uses three features for lookup. See
    :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable` for more details.


Classifier by data table
========================

.. index::
   single: classification; data table

:obj:`ClassifierByExampleTable` is used in similar contexts as
:obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable`. If you write, for instance, a
constructive induction algorithm, it is recommended that the values
of the new feature are computed either by one of classifiers by lookup
table or by ClassifierByExampleTable, depending on the number of bound
features.

.. py:class:: Orange.classification.lookup.ClassifierByExampleTable()

    :obj:`ClassifierByExampleTable` is the alternative to
    :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable`. It is to be used when the
    classification is based on more than three features. Instead of having
    a lookup table, it stores an :obj:`Orange.data.Table`, which is
    optimized for a faster access.
    

    .. attribute:: sortedExamples
        
        A :obj:`Orange.data.Table` with sorted data instances for lookup.
        Instances in the table can be merged; if there were multiple
        instances with the same feature values (but possibly different
        classes), they are merged into a single instance. Regardless of
        merging, class values in this table are distributed: their svalue
        contains a :obj:`Distribution`.

    .. attribute:: classifierForUnknown
        
        This classifier is used to classify instances which were not found
        in the table. If classifierForUnknown is not set, don't know's are
        returned.

    .. attribute:: variables (read only)
        
        A tuple with features in the domain. This field is here so that
        :obj:`ClassifierByExampleTable` appears more similar to
        :obj:`ClassifierByLookupTable`. If a constructive induction
        algorithm returns the result in one of these classifiers, and you
        would like to check which features are used, you can use variables
        regardless of the class you actually got.

    There are no specific methods for ClassifierByExampleTable.
    Since this is a classifier, it can be called. When the instance to be
    classified includes unknown values, :obj:`classifierForUnknown` will be
    used if it is defined.



.. py:class:: Orange.classification.lookup.LookupLearner()
    
    Although :obj:`ClassifierByExampleTable` is not really a classifier in
    the sense that you will use it to classify instances, but is rather a
    function for computation of intermediate values, it has an associated
    learner, :obj:`LookupLearner`. The learner's task is, basically, to
    construct a Table for :obj:`sortedExamples`. It sorts them, merges them
    and, of course, regards instance weights in the process as well.
    
    If data instances are provided to the constructor, the learning algorithm
    is called and the resulting classifier is returned instead of the learner.

part of `lookup-table.py`_ (uses: `monks-1.tab`_):

.. literalinclude:: code/lookup-table.py
    :lines: 7-13


In data_s, we have prepared a table in which instances are described
only by a, b, e and the class. Learner constructs a
ClassifierByExampleTable and stores instances from data_s into its
sortedExamples. Instances are merged so that there are no duplicates.

    >>> print len(data_s)
    432
    >>> print len(abe2.sortedExamples)
    36
    >>> for i in abe2.sortedExamples[:5]:
    ...     print i
    ['1', '1', '1', '1']
    ['1', '1', '2', '1']
    ['1', '1', '3', '1']
    ['1', '1', '4', '1']
    ['1', '2', '1', '1']
    ['1', '2', '2', '0']
    ['1', '2', '3', '0']
    ['1', '2', '4', '0']
    ['1', '3', '1', '1']
    ['1', '3', '2', '0']

Well, there's a bit more here than meets the eye: each instance's class
value also stores the distribution of classes for all instances that
were merged into it. In our case, the three features suffice to
unambiguously determine the classes and, since instances covered the
entire space, all distributions have 12 instances in one of the class
and none in the other.

    >>> for i in abe2.sortedExamples[:10]:
    ...     print i, i.getclass().svalue
    ['1', '1', '1', '1'] <0.000, 12.000>
    ['1', '1', '2', '1'] <0.000, 12.000>
    ['1', '1', '3', '1'] <0.000, 12.000>
    ['1', '1', '4', '1'] <0.000, 12.000>
    ['1', '2', '1', '1'] <0.000, 12.000>
    ['1', '2', '2', '0'] <12.000, 0.000>
    ['1', '2', '3', '0'] <12.000, 0.000>
    ['1', '2', '4', '0'] <12.000, 0.000>
    ['1', '3', '1', '1'] <0.000, 12.000>
    ['1', '3', '2', '0'] <12.000, 0.000>

ClassifierByExampleTable will usually be used by getValueFrom. So, we
would probably continue this by constructing a new feature and put the
classifier into its getValueFrom.

    >>> y2 = orange.EnumVariable("y2", values = ["0", "1"])
    >>> y2.getValueFrom = abe

There's something disturbing here. Although abe determines the value of
y2, abe.classVar is still y. Orange doesn't bother (the whole example
is artificial - you will seldom pack the entire data set in an
ClassifierByExampleTable...), so shouldn't you. But still, for the sake
of hygiene, you can conclude by

    >>> abe.classVar = y2

The whole story can be greatly simplified. LookupLearner can also be
called differently than other learners. Besides instances, you can pass
the new class variable and the features that should be used for
classification. This saves us from constructing data_s and reassigning
the classVar. It doesn't set the getValueFrom, though.

part of `lookup-table.py`_ (uses: `monks-1.tab`_)::

    import Orange

    table = Orange.data.Table("monks-1")
    a, b, e = table.domain["a"], table.domain["b"], table.domain["e"]

    y2 = Orange.data.feature.Discrete("y2", values = ["0", "1"])
    abe2 = Orange.classification.lookup.LookupLearner(y2, [a, b, e], table)

Let us, for the end, show another use of LookupLearner. With the
alternative call arguments, it offers an easy way to observe feature
interactions. For this purpose, we shall omit e, and construct a
ClassifierByExampleTable from a and b only (part of `lookup-table.py`_; uses: `monks-1.tab`_):

.. literalinclude:: code/lookup-table.py
    :lines: 32-35

The script's output show how the classes are distributed for different
values of a and b::

    ['1', '1', '1'] <0.000, 48.000>
    ['1', '2', '0'] <36.000, 12.000>
    ['1', '3', '0'] <36.000, 12.000>
    ['2', '1', '0'] <36.000, 12.000>
    ['2', '2', '1'] <0.000, 48.000>
    ['2', '3', '0'] <36.000, 12.000>
    ['3', '1', '0'] <36.000, 12.000>
    ['3', '2', '0'] <36.000, 12.000>
    ['3', '3', '1'] <0.000, 48.000>

For instance, when a is '1' and b is '3', the majority class is '0',
and the class distribution is 36:12 in favor of '0'.
