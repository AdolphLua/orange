Graphs
======

Orange offers a data structure for representing directed and undirected graphs 
with various types of weighted connections.

Basic graphs have only one type of edges. Each edge can have an associated 
number, representing a strength of the edge - with whatever underlying 
physical interpretation. Orange's graphs are more general and two vertices 
can be connected by edges of various types. One use for this would be in 
genetics, where one gene can excite or inhibit another - or both 
simultaneously, which is why we can't simply assign negative numbers to the 
edges. The number of edge types is unlimited, but needs to be set in advance.

Before constructing a graph, you will also need to decide for the underlying 
data structure. The differences for smaller graphs (e.g. with less than 
100 nodes) should be insignificant, while for the larger, the decision should 
be based upon the expected number of edges ("density" of the graph) and 
the operations you plan to execute. Graphs with large number of edges 
(eg.>n2/4, where n is the number of vertices) should be represented with 
adjacency matrices (class GraphAsMatrix), graphs with small number of edges 
with adjacency lists (GraphAsList) and those in between with adjacency trees 
(GraphAsTrees). Regarding the speed, matrices are generally the fastest, while 
some operations, such as finding all edges leading from certain node, will 
sometimes be faster with lists or trees.

One thing that is not supported (at the moment?) are multiple edges of the 
same type between two vertices.

Construction
============

When constructing a graph, you will need to decide about the data structure for
representation of edges, and call the corresponding constructor. All
constructors take the same arguments: the number of vertices (needs to be given
in advance, you cannot add additional vertices later), a flag telling whether
the graph is directed or not, and the number of edge types. The default number
of edge types is 1 (a normal graph), while the other two arguments are
mandatory.

You can choose between three constructors, all derived from a single ancestor
Graph:

.. class:: GraphAsMatrix(nVertices, directed[, nEdgeTypes])

    Edges are stored in a matrix with either n2 or n(n+1)/2 elements, depending
    upon whether the graph is directed or not. (In C++, it is stored as float *
    pointing to an array of length n*n*nEdgeTypes or (n*(n+1))/2*nEdgeTypes
    elements, where nEdgeTypes is the number of edge types.) This
    representation is suitable for smaller graphs and for dense large graphs.
    For graph with only one edge type, this representation is more economical
    than representation with lists or trees when the number of edges is larger
    than n2/4. Inserting, deleting and checking the edges is fast; listing the
    neighbours of a certain node is fast unless the graph is sparse, in which
    case a graph represented with a list or a tree would be faster.
    
.. class:: GraphAsList(nVertices, directed[, nEdgeTypes]) 
    
    Edges are stored in an ordered lists of neighbours, one list for each node.
    In C++, for each neighbour, the connection is stored in a structure with
    the vertex number (int), a pointer to the next structure, and an array of
    floats, one for each integer. With 16-byte alignment, this would take 16
    bytes for graphs with one or two edge types on the usual 32-bit platforms.
    For undirected graphs, each edge is stored only once, in the list of the
    edge with the smaller index. This makes the structure smaller and insertion
    and lookup faster; it slows down finding the neighbours of a given node.
    This structure is convenient for graphs with a very small number of edges.
    For them, inserting and removing edges is relatively fast; getting all
    edges leading from a vertex is fast, while getting edges leading to a
    vertex or getting all neighbours (in directed or undirected graph) is slow.
    
.. class:: GraphAsTree(nVertices, directed[, nEdgeTypes]) 
    
    This structure is similar to GraphAsTree except that the edges are stored
    in trees instead of lists. This should be a structure of choice for all
    graph between really sparse and those having one quarter of possible edges.
    As expected, queries are fast, while insertion and removal of edges is
    somewhat slower (though still faster than for GraphAsList unless the number
    of edges is really small). Internally, nodes of the tree contain the vertex
    number, two pointers and a list of floats. With one edge type, this should
    be 16 bytes on 32-bit platforms. An ordinary undirected graph with 10
    vertices stored in a matrix would thus be constructed by

Examples
--------

graph = orange.GraphAsMatrix(10, 0)

A directed graph with 1000 vertices and edges of three types, stored with
adjacency trees would be constructed by

graph = orange.GraphAsTree(1000, 1, 3)

Usage
=====

All three graph types are used the same way, independent of the underlying
structure. All methods are defined in basic class :obj:Orange.network.Graph.

.. class:: Graph

    .. attribute:: nVertices
    
        The number of vertices (read-only, set at construction)
    
    .. attribute:: nEdgeTypes
    
        The number of different edge types (read-only, set at construction)
    
    .. attribute:: directed
    
        Tells whether the graph is directed (read-only, set at construction)
    
    .. attribute:: objects
    
        A dictionary, list or other sequence of objects that correspond to
        graph nodes. The use of this object is described in section on
        indexing.

    .. attribute:: forceMapping

        Determines whether to map integer indices through 'objects'. Details are
        described below.

    .. attribute:: returnIndices

        If set, the methods that return list of neighbours will return lists of
        integers even when objects are given.

    .. Basic Operations
    .. ----------------

    .. Indexing
    .. --------
    
    Vertices are referred to by either integer indices or Python objects of any
    type. In the latter case, a mapping should be provided by assigning the
    'objects' attribute. For instance, if you set graph.objects to ["Age",
    "Gender", "Height", "Weight"] then graph["Age", "Height"] would be equivalent
    to graph[0, 2] and graph.getNeighbours("Weight") to graph.getNeighbours(3).
    Vertex identifier doesn't need to be a string, , it can be any Python
    object.
    
    If objects contains a dictionary, its keys are vertex identifiers and the
    values in the dictionary should be integers, eg.
    
    graph.objects = {}
    graph.objects["Age"] = 0
    graph.objects[None] = 1
    graph.objects[orange] = 4

    If not a dictionary, objects can be any kind of sequence. Usually, you will
    give it a list of the same length as the number of vertices in the graph,
    so each element would identify a vertex. When indexing, the index is sought
    for in the list. objects can also be a list of attributes, a domain, an
    example table or even a single string; Orange will run a code equivalent to
    "for o in graph.objects", so everything for which such a loop works, goes.
    
    Searching through the list is, of course, rather slow, so it is recommended
    to use integer indices for larger graphs. So, if you request
    graph.getNeighbours(0), the method will return the neighbours of the first
    vertex, even if objects is given. But - what if you want to map all
    indices, even integers, through objects? In this case, you need to set
    graph.forceMapping to 1. If graph.forceMapping is set and graph.objects is
    given, even getNeighbours(0) will search the graph.objects for 0 and return
    the neighbours of the corresponding (not necessarily the first) node.

    .. Getting and Setting Edges
    .. -------------------------
    
    .. method:: graph[v1, v2]
    
        For ordinary graphs with a single edge type, graph[v1, v2] returns the
        weight of the edge between v1 and v2, or None if there is no edge
        (edge's weight can also be 0). Edges can also be set by assigning them
        a weight, e.g.graph[2, 5]=1.5. As described above, if objects is set,
        we can use other objects, such as names, as v1 and v2 (the same goes
        for all other functions described below). For graphs with multiple edge
        types, graph[v1, v2] returns a list of weights for various edge types.
        Some (or all, if there is no edge) elements of the list can be None. If
        the edge does not exist, graph[v1, v2] returns a list of Nones, not a
        None. You can assign a list to graph[v1, v2]; in graph with three edge
        types you can set graph[2, 5] = [1.5, None, -2.0]. After that, there
        are two edges between vertices 2 and 5, one of the first type with
        weight 1.5, and one of the third with weight -2.0. To remove an edge,
        you can assign it a least of Nones or a single None, e.g. graph[2,
        5]=None; this removes edges of all types between the two nodes. The
        list returned for graphs with multiple edge types is actually a
        reference to the edge, therefore you can set e = graph[v1, v2] and then
        manipulate e, for instance e[1]=10 or e[0]=None. Edge will behave just
        as an ordinary list (well, almost - no slicing ets). However, don't try
        to assign a list to e, eg e=[1, None, 4]. This assigns a list to e, not
        to the corresponding edge... graph[v1, v2, type] This is defined only
        for graph with multiple edge types; it returns the weight for the edge
        of type type between v1 and v2, or None if there is no such edge. You
        can also establish an edge by assigning a weight (e.g. graph[2, 5, 2] =
        -2.0) or remove it by assigning it a None (graph[2, 5, 2] = None).
        edgeExists(v1, v2[, type]) Returns true if the edge between v1 and v2
        exists. For multiple edge type graphs you can also specify the type of
        the edge you check for. If the third argument is omitted, the method
        returns true if there is any kind of edge between the two vertices. It
        is recommended to use this method when you want to check for a node. In
        single edge type graphs, if graph[v1, v2]: will fail when there is an
        edge but it has a weight of zero. With multiple edge types, if
        graph[v1, v2]: will always success since graph[v1, v2] returns a non-
        empty list; if there is no edges, this will be a list of Nones, but
        Python still treats it as "true". addCluster(list_of_vertices) Creates
        a cluster - adds edges between all listed vertices. Queries
        
        Graph provides a set of function that return nodes connected to a
        certain node.
    
    .. method:: getNeighbours(v1[, type])
    
        Returns all the nodes that are connected to v1. In directed graphs,
        this includes vertices with edges toward or from v1. In graphs with
        multiple edge types you can also specify the edge type you are
        interested in: getNeighbours will the return only the vertices that are
        connected to v1 by edges of that type.
    
    .. method:: getEdgesFrom(v1[, type])
    
        Return all the vertices which are connected to v1 by the edges leading
        from v1. In edges with multiple edge types, you can specify the edge
        type. In undirected graph, this function is equivalent to
        getNeighbours.
    
    .. method:: getEdgesTo(v1[, type])
    
        Returns all the vertices with edges leading to v1. Again, you can
        decide for a single edge type to observe, and, again again, in
        undirected graphs this function is equivalent to getNeighbours.
        
        If objects is set, functions return a list of objects (names of
        vertices or whatever objects you stored in objects). Otherwise, a list
        of integer indices is returned. If you want to force Graph to return
        integer indices even if objects is set, set graph.returnIndices to
        True.
        
        Of the three operations, the expensive one is to look for the vertices
        with edges pointing to the given edge. There is no problem when graph
        is represented as a matrix (graphAsMatrix); these are always fast. On
        directed graph, getEdgeFrom is always fast as well.
        
        In undirected graphs represented as lists or trees, the edge between
        vertices with indices v1 and v2 is stored at the list/tree in the
        smaller of the two indices. Therefore to list all neighbours of v1,
        edges with v2<v1 are copied form v1's list, while for edges with v2>v1
        the function needs to look for v1 in each v2's list/tree. Lookup in
        trees is fast, while in representation with adjacency list, the
        function is slower for v1 closer to nVertices/2. If v1 is small there
        is a great number of v2>v1 whose lists are to be checked, but since the
        lists are ordered, v1 is more to the beginning of these lists (and when
        a vertex with index higher than v1 is encountered, we know that v1 is
        not on the list). If v2 is great, there it is more toward the end of
        the list, but there is smaller number of lists to be checked.
        Generally, the average number of traversed list elements for
        getNeighbours/getEdgesFrom/getEdgesTo on undirected graphs with
        p*nVertices2 edges is p(nVertices-v1)v1.
        
        To sum up, if you have a large undirected graph and intend to query for 
        neighbours (or, equivalently, edges to or from a node) a lot, don't use 
        GraphAsList. If the graph is small or you won't use these functions, it 
        doesn't matter.
        
        For directed graphs, getEdgesFrom is trivial. The other two functions
        are even slower than for undirected graphs, since to find the edges
        leading from any vertex to a given one, all lists/trees need to be
        searched. So, if your algorithm will extensively use getEdgesTo or
        getNeighbours and your graph is large but the number of edges is less
        than nEdges2/2, you should use GraphAsTree or, to be faster but consume
        more memory store the graph as GraphAsMatrix. If the number of edges is
        greater, GraphAsMatrix is more economic anyway. (This calculation is
        for graph with only one edge type; see the description of graph types
        for details.
        
        However, this is all programmed in C++, so whatever you do, the
        bottleneck will probably still be in your Python code and not in C++.
        You probably cannot miss by using GraphAsTree disregarding the size of
        the graph and the operations you perform on it.
