Orange - Data Mining Fruitful and Fun
============================

Installation Instructions
=========================
Get the .tar.gz file. After unpacking change to the top-level directory.

Orange can be installed in two ways: locally in a user directory or in the 
system directories.

1. SYSTEM INSTALLATION
   Using the python into which you wish to install Orange, execute as root:

     python setup.py install

   Depending on the Linux distribution you are using you should get something like this:
   /usr/lib/python3.2/site-packages/orange              - Orange files
   /usr/lib/python3.2/site-packages/orange/orange.pth   - path file to Orange used by Python
   /usr/share/doc/orange                                - Orange Documentation, data sets, etc.
   /usr/lib/                                            - links to .so files
   /usr/bin/orange                                      - shortcut to Canvas


2. USER, LOCAL INSTALLATION
   Using the python into which you wish to install Orange, execute as normal user:

     python setup.py install --orangepath=<target directory where orange directory should be created>

   You should get a similar structure:
   <target dir>/orange/      - Orange files
   <target dir>/doc/         - Orange Documentation
   orange.pth                - path file to Orange used by Python


   See the Distutils documentation for many command-line options as to
   installation locations, etc.



BUILDING AND INSTALLING Orange FROM SOURCE
Using the python into which you wish to install Orange, execute:

     python setup.py build

Then follow the general Installation Instructions (see above).



UNINSTALLING Orange
Depending on the type of installation you should be root or normal user, execute:

python <DOC installation directory>/setup.py uninstall

<DOC installation directory> is usually /usr/share/doc/orange, buy might be different depending on your Linux distribution.

This will remove Orange, canvas, Orange documentation and links to Orange libraries
