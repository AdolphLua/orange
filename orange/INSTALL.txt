Orange - Data Mining Fruitful and Fun
============================

Prerequisites
=========================
In order to run Orange Canvas - the visual programming front end of Orange - you will 
need to have Qt, PyQt installed. On Fedora Core 3 this can be achieved by executing 
the following command:

     yum groupinstall "KDE Software Development"


Running Orange Canvas
=========================
The system installation should create a shortcut to Orange Canvas, a script:
/usr/bin/orange
which is equivalent to executing the following command (might vary among
Linux distributions):
python /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/orange/OrangeCanvas/orngCanvas.pyw


Installation Instructions
=========================
Get the .tar.gz file. After unpacking change to the top-level directory.

The binary distribution is prepared in Fedora Core 3. In case you need to 
recompile for your distribution of Linux, follow the instructions on how to
compile from source. Sources are included in the binary distribution.

Orange can be installed in two ways: locally in a user directory or in the 
system directories.

1. SYSTEM INSTALLATION
   Using the python into which you wish to install Orange, execute as root:

     python setup.py install

   Depending on the Linux distribution you are using you should get something like this:
   /usr/lib/python3.2/site-packages/orange              - Orange files
   /usr/lib/python3.2/site-packages/orange/orange.pth   - path file to Orange used by Python
   /usr/share/doc/orange                                - Orange Documentation, data sets, etc.
   /usr/lib/                                            - links to .so files
   /usr/bin/orange                                      - shortcut to Canvas


2. USER, LOCAL INSTALLATION
   Using the python into which you wish to install Orange, execute as normal user:

     python setup.py install --orangepath=<target directory where orange directory should be created>

   You should get a similar structure:
   <target dir>/orange/      - Orange files
   <target dir>/doc/         - Orange Documentation
   orange.pth                - path file to Orange used by Python


   See the Distutils documentation for many command-line options as to
   installation locations, etc.



BUILDING AND INSTALLING Orange FROM SOURCE
Using the python into which you wish to install Orange, execute:

     python setup.py build

Then follow the general Installation Instructions (see above).



UNINSTALLING Orange
Depending on the type of installation you should be root or normal user, execute:

python <DOC installation directory>/setup.py uninstall

<DOC installation directory> is usually /usr/share/doc/orange, buy might be different depending on your Linux distribution.

This will remove Orange, canvas, Orange documentation and links to Orange libraries
