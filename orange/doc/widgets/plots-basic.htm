<H1>Using the new 'plot' module</H1>

<p>Orange has a new plotting interface via the <code>OrangeWidgets.plot</code>
module. The OWPlot class use Qt's graphics framework and was written specifically for
Orange, so it contains methods more suitable to its data structures. It also provides
most methods also found in the Qwt-based OWGraph, so switching from one base
to another is quite easy. </p>

<p>In the other example (<a href="">plots</a>) we showed how little modification 
is used to replace OWGraph with OWPlot. 
On the other hand, this example shows that using OWPlot from the start can be much easier. 
We will implement the simplest graph: a series of points with x and y coordinates, 
and different colors, sizes and shapes.
