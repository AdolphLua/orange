<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This widget allows for manual selection of association rules based on their support and confidence.</p>

<table><td>
<img class="screenshot" src="AssociationRulesFilter.png" alt="Association Rules Filter Widget" border=0></td>

<td>
<P>The columns of the grid on the left hand side of the widget represent different supports and the rows represents confidences. The scale is given above the grid: for the case in this snapshot, support goes from 28% to 75% and the confidence ranges from 29% to 100%. Each cell is colored according to the number of rules with that particular support and confidence - the darker the cell, the more rules are inside it.</P>

<P>You can select a part of the grid. In the snapshot we selected the rules with supports between 36% and 66% and confidences from 33% to 82%. The corresponding ten rules are shown in the list below.</P>

<P>If <b>Send rules automatically</b> is checked, the rule list is sent on the output after each selection. If not, you need to press <b>Send Rules</b> to send it.</P>

<P>When the widget receives the data, it shows the area which contains some rules. You can <b>Zoom</b> in to enlarge the selected part, push <b>Show All</b> to see the region with the rules again, or <b>No Zoom</b> to see the region with supports and confidences from 0 to 1. <b>Unselect</b> removes the selection.</P>

<P>If nothing is selected, the widget outputs all shown rules.</P>
