<p>Orange Widgets are building blocks of Orange's interactive
exploratory data analysis suite. We have spent much time on writing
many widgets in the past several years. While we really like widgets,
and we even like programming them (as having a nice visual component
of your own can be really rewarding), we also got a bit lazy. Being
lazy is intrinsic to any human, so we aimed at minimizing our effort
(e.g., fewest lines possible) while maximizing the outcome (building
some nice widgets fast). To do this, we have set up the environment
(base widget class) and several libraries to please us, the
developers. If you are about to start writing your own widgets, or are
just interested how we do it, the following documentation should get
you started.</p>
