<H1>Orange Documentation</H1>

<p>If you are new to Orange,
we recommend you to start with <a href="ofb/default.htm">Orange for Beginners</a>,
a step-by-step tutorial through basic Orange functions.</p>

<p>A more in-depth documentation that is being prepared is called <a href="reference/default.htm">Orange Reference Guide</a>. It describes the basic data
structures used in Orange (such as examples, attributes...), preprocessing,
learning and classifying etc.</p>

<p>An average user will mostly call Orange through specialized <a href="modules/default.htm">Orange modules</a>. Each module covers a specific task (discretization, feature subset selection, sampling, assessing qualities of models) or learning method.</p>
