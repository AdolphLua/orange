<h1>Orange Modules</h1>
<BR>

<p>Orange modules are intended to extend basic Orange's functionality, or provide wrappers for easier use of some data mining techniques. They are already included in normal Orange distribution. Following set of pages provides description, demos and examples for selected modules. Following modules are included [for links that do not work, documentation is in writing - sorry]:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="orngAssoc.htm">orngAssoc</a></dt><dd>Wrapper around Orange's association rules generator (builds association rules, prints them out).</dd>
<dt><a href="orngCI.htm">orngCI</a></dt><dd>Constructive induction (function decomposition methods, HINT, Kramer's constructive induction method).</dd>
<dt><a href="orngDisc.htm">orngDisc</a></dt><dd>Wrapper around Orange's categorization techniques for continuous attributes.</dd>
<dt><a href="orngEnsemble.htm">orngEnsemble</a></dt><dd>Bagging, boosting.</dd>
<dt>orngEval</dt><dd>Obsolete, included for compatibility with past version of Orange. Use orngTest and orngStat instead.</dd>
<dt><a href="orngFSS.htm">orngFSS</a></dt><dd>Feature subset selection.</dd>
<dt><a href="orngLookup.htm">orngLookup</a></dt><dd>Functions for working with classifiers with stored tables of examples.</dd>
<dt><a href="orngStat.htm">orngStat</a></dt><dd>This module takes an object that stores the results of evaluation of learning methods prepared by orngTest, and computes various statistics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, information gain, area under ROC, ...</dd>
<dt><a href="orngTest.htm">orngTest</a></dt><dd>A module for testing of the learning algorithms. Includes methods for data sampling and splitting, and for testing of learners. Among others, it implements cross-validation,  leave-one out, random sampling, learning curves. It prepares an object that stores the results on test data and that is used in orngStat to assess various statistics.</dd>
<dt><a href="orngTree.htm">orngTree</a></dt><dd>Wrapper around Orange's classification tree inducer. Most notably, implements tree printout and visualization.</dd>

<p>Additional modules for data mining (clustering, SVM wrapper for
probability estimation, logistic regression, density estimation...)
have been prepared by Aleks Jakulin and are accessible via <a href=
"http://ai.fri.uni-lj.si/~aleks/orng/">his pages</a>.</p>
