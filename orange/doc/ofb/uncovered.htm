<H1>Things We Did Not Cover</H1>
<br>

<p>While this tutorial was meant to give you the taste of what can
be done with Orange Scripting, the things you have learned may be
sufficient, for instance, to try out and implement some ideas you
have for machine learning and data mining. However, we should warn
you that Orange contains many other things that perhaps we did not
even mention. You should browse through <a href=
"../default.htm">
Orange&rsquo;s documentation</a> to find more.</p>

<p>If you wish not only to use but also to contribute to Orange,
please <a href="http://magix.fri.uni-lj.si/orange/support.asp">contact us</a>
and send us your scripts and ideas.</p>
