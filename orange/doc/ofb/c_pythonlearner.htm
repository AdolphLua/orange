<H1>Build Your Own Learner</H1>

<p>This part of tutorial will show how to build learners and
classifiers in Python, that is, how to build your own learners and
classifiers. Especially for those of you that want to test some of
your methods or want to combine existing techniques in Orange, this
is a very important topic. We view it as a crucial essence of
Orange, since it makes prototyping of new methods fast and
enjoyable.</p>

<p>There are different ways to build learners/classifiers in
Python. We will take the route that shows how to do this correctly,
in a sense that you will be able to use your learner as it would
be any learner that Orange originally provides. What are the specifics
of Orange learners and classifiers? Mainly, the ways they are
invoked and what the return. Let us say that Learner() is some
learner in Orange. Essentially, it can be called in two different
ways:</p>

<xmp class="code">learner = Learner()
classifier = Learner(data)
</xmp>

<p>In the first line, the learner
is invoked without the data set and in that case it
should return an instance of learner, such that later you may say
<code>classifier = learner(data)</code> or you may call some validation
procedure with a <code>learner</code> itself (say
<code>orngEval.CrossValidation([learner], data)</code>). In the second
line, learner is called with the data and returns a classifier.</p>

<p>Classifiers should be called with a data instance to classify,
and should return either a class value (by default), probability of
classes or both:</p>

<xmp class="code">value = classifier(instance)
value = classifier(instance, orange.GetValue)
probabilities = classifier(instance, orange.GetProbabilities)
value, probabilities = classifier(instance, orange.GetBoth)
</xmp>

<p>Here is a short example:</p>

<pre class="code">
> <strong>python</strong>
>>> <strong>import orange</strong>
>>> <strong>data = orange.ExampleTable("voting")</strong>
>>> <strong>learner = orange.BayesLearner()</strong>
>>> <strong>classifier = learner(data)</strong>
>>> <strong>classifier(data[0])</strong>
republican
>>> <strong>classifier(data[0], orange.GetBoth)</strong>
(republican, [0.99999994039535522, 7.9730767765795463e-008])
>>> <strong>classifier(data[0], orange.GetProbabilities)</strong>
[0.99999994039535522, 7.9730767765795463e-008]
>>> 
>>> <strong>c = orange.BayesLearner(data)</strong>
>>> <strong>c(data[12])</strong>
democrat
>>>
</pre>

<p>Throughout our examples, we will assume that our learner and the
corresponding classifier will be defined in a single file (module)
that will not contain any other code. This helps for code reuse, so
that if you want to use your new method anywhere else, you just import
it from that file. Each such module will contain a function <code>a
class <code>Learner_Class</code> and a class
<code>Classifier</code>.</p> We will use this schema to define a
learner that will use <a href="c_nb_disc.htm">naive Bayesian method
but will categorize the data</a> before learning. We will then show
how to write <a href= "c_nb.htm">your own naive Bayesian method</a> in
Python (that is, from scratch), and we will conclude with an example
of how to use the schema presented here for a <a
href="c_bagging.htm">bagged learner</a>.</p>
