All files should reside in directories ofb, reference and
modules. html2asp does not copy subdirectories.

Each file needs to have a <h1> heading, which is used to extract the
page's title. Those headings are removed in .asp version.

Hrefs pointing to files in the local directory (those that will be
included in distribution) should be either 'href="<filename>.htm(l)'
or 'href="..\<directory>\<filename>.htm(l)'. This may be followed by
whatever you want (usualy a quote or hash). Only href's in this format
will be converted into asp's; additionaly, if such a file is missing,
a warning shall be given.

All other hrefs must be a full address,
i.e. "http://magix.fri.uni-lj.si/orange/default.asp" and not simply
"/orange/default.asp" or "/orange". This is because they must also
function on local machine (.html version of documentation).

Filenames are case-sensitive. If you miss the case, you'll get a
warning, but the script and the web site will still work.
